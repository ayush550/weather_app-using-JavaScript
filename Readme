Hello!

I've created this weather app using JavaScript to test out some of my learnings till now.
I've taken the help of "Code Explained" for this app.

In this app I've used OpenWeatherMap as API provider:
http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat="latitude"&lon="longitude"&appid="Key"

we can get the key after creating an account on OpenWeatherMap, however I've used the key as provided by the "Code Explained"
